    """
    An multi-agent learned with Advantage Actor-Critic
    - Actor takes its local observations as input
    - agent interact with environment to collect experience
    - agent training with experience to update policy

    Parameters
    - training_strategy:
        - cocurrent

            - multiple policies are optimize
